The Future:
  After completing my A-Levels I hope to attend university completing a course in Computer Science. With my degree I hope to get a good and stable job that is fun and also brings in a comfertable income.

Current Projects:
  Coursework Game
    I am currently working on my ALevel course work, for this project I have decided to make a game centred around managing a restaurant. This 
  Learning Unity

Previous projects:
  Animonopoly -https://github.com/BHASVIC-ryancheung24/animalshared
    This was a group project based on a modified version of Monopoly, this game helped me understand working in a group better and the collaberation that comes with it 
  Hotel Kashique
    This was another group project which introduced me to the basics of C and working in a group

  - Trips
       - Evolve 25, this trip was full of different brands that are paving the way in the tech world, many of them experimenting with new AI and technologies. This gave me an insite into the commerical industry and what a career in tech may look like.    
  
  - Sussex Uni informatics work experience
     - I completed Sussex Uni's Informatics and Engeneering work experience program, heres a quick sumery:
 Monday 
Introduction to AI and CNNs testing out of leaning machine.

We used the website Teachable Machine in order to start our AI training journey, this gave us a more simple and understandable experience with AI by  giving us a simple and easy to understand GUI, my group did audio training in order to recognize people saying certain numbers. We chose the numbers 1,2,3,4 and trained the model using our voice from our group. We were quite successful in our training of the model and it managed to recognize the numbers even when given voices that were not part of our group. However we did find that with different accents and other pronunciations different from ours, we discovered that the model is not as good at recognizing the numbers. This showed the importance of having a wide variety of data for the model to be trained on as if there is only a specific small section of data the model may become bias. 


Tuesday
Made a CNN and did a competition 
We used actual python and and a terminal in order to create and CNN that recognizes written numbers, we used a large dataset that was used by the post office to recognize different numbers of letters and parcels. We changed settings such at batch number, episodes and tweaked setting like filter resolution in order to see how they effected the accuracy and efficiency of the AI. In the end I managed to reached an accuracy of around 97%.

Wednesday 
We learned about CAD and CFD simulations, flows, drag.
At the start we were introduced to the science behind bird wings, we used CAD to make this on a program called SolidWorks this is a commerically used program which gave be professional experience.
In solid works you are able to do simulations with CFD this helped us understand the different facotrs that contribute to lift and drag on the wing.

Thursday
We put our wings into a physical wind tunnel, this gave me experience with real world machinery.

Friday
We worked on a real world TV studio working with professional cameras and technologies such as LED walls that have been used in shows such as The Mandalorian
